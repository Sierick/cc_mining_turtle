# cc_mining_turtle
code for turtle's in the Minecraft mod computer craft

Things left to improve:
Mining instead of 1 by 3 make it mine in a chunk loading effiecent way
Make it so it returns home a different way if it's inventory is full versus not full
ex:
Full it just comes back
Not full it mines back

Final thing would be to automate the setup process further and making them be controlled together in a smart way but that is a project for another day

Bugs:
When diamonds are mined they don't stack very well but that's okay because really it just means when it gets diamonds it comes home shortly after
